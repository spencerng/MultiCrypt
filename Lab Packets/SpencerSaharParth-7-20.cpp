// ( Airline Reservations System) A small airline has just purchased a computer for its
// new automated reservations system. You have been asked to program the new
// system. You are to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the airline's only
// plane (capacity: 10 seats).
// Your program should display the following menu of alternativesPlease type 1 for
// "First Class" and Please type 2 for "Economy". If the person types 1, your program
// should assign a seat in the first class section (seats 1-5). If the person types 2, your
// program should assign a seat in the economy section (seats 6-10). Your program
// should print a boarding pass indicating the person's seat number and whether it is in
// the first class or economy section of the plane.
// Use a one-dimensional array to represent the seating chart of the plane. Initialize all
// the elements of the array to 0 to indicate that all seats are empty. As each seat is
// assigned, set the corresponding elements of the array to 1 to indicate that the seat
// is no longer available.
// Your program should, of course, never assign a seat that has already been assigned.
// When the first class section is full, your program should ask the person if it is
// acceptable to be placed in the economy section (and vice versa). If yes, then make
// the appropriate seat assignment. If no, then print the message "Next flight leaves
// in 3 hours".
