// 5 Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem. Read in 20 numbers,
// each of which is between 10 and 100, inclusive. As each number is read, validate it
// and store it in the array only if it is not a duplicate of a number already read. After
// reading all the values, display only the unique values that the user entered. Provide
// for the "worst case" in which all 20 numbers are different. Use the smallest possible
// array to solve this problem.
